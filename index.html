        <h1>I Love you Adity Babaaaaaaa,I havve been thinking... you know how they say "great things come in small packages"? Well, I was wondering if we could take that literally. Because, truth be told, I am absolutely smitten with youâ€”and it is got me thinking why not create a mini version of the awesomeness that is you?

        I mean, think about it we could have a tiny little Aaru running around, making the world an even better and cuter place! You and me, as partners-in-crime, and a mini you? Talk about an epic trio. </h1>
